---> I'm still pretty much an idiot. I have been writing some things that I will try and get in a legible cohesive framing and let everyone check it out. I'm new and a little nervous so keep checking back around and see what I have tried to what I call creativityism. 
Technology is art in motion. You can write that down and call your own. Thank you allowing allowing a world full of such beautiful creative minds to a platform to create and collaborate ego system that's going to be a joy and pain to try and process all this . Thank you for all the opportunities owners and bosses and other great minds already in this beautiful place. See you guys very soon!!
